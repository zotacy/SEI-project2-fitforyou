Fit For You App

REQUIREMENTS- Project 2
A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc. Inside Your README.md:
    Check this file for a README template
    Include at least 10 User Stories
    Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
    Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo

Project Links
    github repo
    deployment
Wireframes
    Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

wireframes
    react architecture
    Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

MVP/PostMVP - 5min
    The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

MVP EXAMPLE
    Find and use external api
    Render data on page
    Allow user to interact with the page

PostMVP EXAMPLE
    Add localStorage or firebase for storage
    Components
    Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
    Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

Component    Description
    App    This will make the initial data pull and include React Router
    Header    This will render the header include the nav
    Footer    This will render the header include the nav

Time Frames
    Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

Component    Priority    Estimated Time    Time Invetsted    Actual Time
    Adding Form    H    3hrs    3.5hrs    3.5hrs
    Working with API    H    3hrs    2.5hrs    2.5hrs
    Total    H    6hrs    5hrs    5hrs

Additional Libraries
    Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.

Code Snippet
    Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description. Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.

function reverse(string) {
    // here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
Issues and Resolutions
    Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.
