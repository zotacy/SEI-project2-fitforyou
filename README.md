Fit For You App

REQUIREMENTS- Project 2
A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc. Inside Your README.md:
   - Check this file for a README template
   - Include at least 10 User Stories
   - Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
   - Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo
User Stories:

Project Links
   - github repo
   - deployment
Wireframes
   - Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.
   Lucid Chart (SQL Tables)- https://lucid.app/invitations/accept 94634b63-8457-43fe-bb32-4273a89c122a

wireframes
   - react architecture
   - Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

MVP/PostMVP - 5min
   - The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.
   - Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

MVP EXAMPLE
   - Find and use external api
   - Render data on page
   - Allow user to interact with the page

PostMVP EXAMPLE
   - Add localStorage or firebase for storage
    Components
   - Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
   - Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

Component    Description
    App    This will make the initial data pull and include React Router
    Header    This will render the header include the nav
    Footer    This will render the header include the nav

Time Frames
   -  Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

Component    Priority    Estimated Time    Time Invetsted    Actual Time
    Adding Form    H    3hrs    3.5hrs    3.5hrs
    Working with API    H    3hrs    2.5hrs    2.5hrs
    Total    H    6hrs    5hrs    5hrs

Additional Libraries
   - Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.

Code Snippet
   - Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description. Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.

function reverse(string) {
    // here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
